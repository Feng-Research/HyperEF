# HyperEF

Ali Aghdaei, Zhuo Feng

HyperEF introduces a scalable algorithmic framework for spectral coarsening (decomposition) of large-scale hypergraphs by exploiting hyperedge effective resistances. Motivated by the latest theoretical framework for  low-resistance-diameter decomposition of simple graphs, HyperEF aims at decomposing large hypergraphs into multiple node clusters with only a few inter-cluster hyperedges. The key component in HyperEF is a nearly-linear time  algorithm for estimating hyperedge  effective resistances, which allows incorporating the latest diffusion-based non-linear quadratic operators defined on hypergraphs. To achieve good runtime scalability, HyperEF searches within the Krylov subspace (or approximate eigensubspace) for identifying the nearly-optimal vectors for approximating the hyperedge effective resistances. In addition, a  node weight propagation scheme for multilevel spectral hypergraph decomposition   has been introduced for achieving even greater  node coarsening ratios. When compared with state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning (clustering) methods, extensive experiment results on real-world VLSI designs show that HyperEF can more effectively coarsen (decompose) hypergraphs   without losing  key structural (spectral) properties of the original hypergraphs, while achieving over $70\times$ runtime speedups over hMetis and $20\times$ speedups over HyperSF.
